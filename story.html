                            Nearly three decades ago, in the harsh winter of 1991, a group of devoted church
                            parishioners, led
                            by four remarkable and determined women, were moved by the plight of those sleeping rough in
                            Perth.
                            Fueled by their deep concern and boundless compassion, they took action, giving birth to
                            Churches
                            Action for the Homeless (CATH). This compassionate endeavor began with a humble soup
                            kitchen,
                            staffed entirely by dedicated volunteers, including the original quartet of ladies who have
                            since
                            earned the endearing title of the 'Founding Mothers of CATH'.

                        <p>
                            In the early days, CATH operated on a modest scale, offering basic services such as
                            meals, clothing, and a safe space for those experiencing homelessness. Their first shelter
                            was a
                            small church hall where volunteers worked tirelessly to provide warmth and comfort to those
                            in
                            need.

                        <p>
                            As the years passed, CATH's mission evolved. Recognizing that homelessness was a
                            complex issue with deep-seated roots, they expanded their services to include counseling,
                            addiction support, and job training programs. This holistic approach aimed not only to
                            provide
                            immediate relief but also to empower individuals to regain stability and independence.

                            By the 2010s, CATH had become a cornerstone of the Perth & Kinross community. Their
                            outreach extended beyond shelters and into the streets, where dedicated teams engaged with
                            those
                            living rough, offering them not only immediate assistance but also the prospect of a
                            brighter
                            future.

                            As the organization continued to grow, CATH leveraged its influence to advocate for
                            systemic change. They worked closely with local government agencies, leveraging their
                            expertise
                            and firsthand experience to shape policies that addressed the underlying causes of
                            homelessness.

                            Today, CATH stands as a testament to the power of collective action
                            and unwavering compassion. Through decades of dedication and resilience, they have not only
                            provided essential support to those experiencing homelessness but also inspired a community
                            to
                            come together in the fight against this pressing issue. Their story serves as a beacon of
                            hope,
                            reminding us all that positive change is possible when individuals and communities work hand
                            in

                            Colin Craig started with Positive Pathways in June 2023. When Craig started with Positive Pathways he was working on his recovery, and he is making great progress. Colin has achieved so much in the 5 months that he has been engaging in the programme.
                            <br>
                            Colin attends every week and engages in topic discussions, non-accredited learning, health and well- being activities as well as supporting other group participants. Craig has completed accredited training on First Aid for Mental Health and passed the course. He has also signed up with Perth UHI in partnership with positive Pathways and he is in the process of completing a Bronze ASDAN Award.
                            <br>
                            He has also taken part in a video of his journey with CATH Positive Pathways, which was used at the National Homeless Conference! Colin is an inspiration to the group, and he is a credit to himself.

                            Darren and Paul moved up to Perth on 19/7/2023. They came to CATH for assistance as they were homeless and were given a tent and sleeping bags initially until a homelessness application could be done for them.
                            <br>
                            As a result of help from “day centre” staff Darren and Paul were given temporary accommodation in Greyfriars hostel. From there they were in a private let property but continued to have contact with the day centre.
                            <br>
                            They had a few changes of address through the years but continued to get help from CATH.
                            <br>
                            Darren and Paul have continued to use the services of the community hub ( back then it was known as the day centre). They have come to the community hub for help with benefits and any housing issues since 2013
                            <br>
                            Darren said that he appreciates the fact that as well as coming to the centre for their meals and any assistance he felt safe in the knowledge that if they were not in the centre for a length of time someone within the outreach team would do a wellbeing check on them or they would get a phone call from the “day centre” . Both Darren and Paul continue in their recovery from their addiction and Darren has been a volunteer with CATH.
                            <br>
                            They would encourage anyone else seeking help to come to CATH Community Hub and speak to any member of staff and not to fear any judgement of their situation or circumstances.
                            <br>
                            Darren and Paul feel that help from CATH has got them where they are today.

                            been able to actively engage with services to drastically improve her own living situation.
                            From getting back in touch with her Housing Officer to being approved for funding that has
                            since cleared all of her energy debts.

                            Leonard was referred to us in August. Due to mobility and health issues Leonard was struggling to keep up with household tasks. He has been waiting to get his windows done but couldn't until the house was cleared.
                            <br>
                            Once meeting we came up with a plan on how to sort certain issues. There was furniture needing cleared so we made a referral to unpaid work who came to collect it.
                            <br>
                            Leonard managed each week to clear items from his home and we helped take it to the skip.
                            <br>
                            While doing this we filled out a Community Care Grant for flooring, fridge/freezer, washing machine and cooker which has now been granted.
                            <br>
                            Due to mobility issues Leonard needed seating in his living room high up enough so he was able to sit down comfortably without having to throw himself back which he had been doing in the past. I applied for the Annie Unwin fund where I was then able to purchase a rise and recline chair to suit his needs.
                            <br>
                            Leonard has now been told his flat is adequate enough for new windows to be fitted so this is a massive achievement along with all the other needs met.

                            JT has been supported by CATH Outreach Team and FHS over the last few years, John moved into his first home during covid. JT has been supported with various housing issues including referral food parcels and referral to the Heat Project, JT has recently been supported to apply to the Annie Unwin Trust for bathroom flooring.
                            <br>
                            JT had a slow leak from the shower unit which damaged his bathroom flooring beyond repair, JT had been without bathroom flooring for the last few months and was having to step out of the shower on to bare chipboard which was becoming wet and starting to chip and splinter. CATH Outreach Team looked into available funding and applied for the Annie Unwin Trust Grant. The funding application was successful and CATH Outreach
                            <br>
                            Team supported JT to choose new flooring and the funding also covered the cost of the fitting.
                            <br>
                            JT is very happy with his new flooring

                            "In November I will have resided here 3 years. In that time, I have experienced several problems and dilemmas both mental and physical.
                            <br>
                            On the mental side there was always staff available to console me when needed as well as the need to 'put me right' when appropriate. On the physical side I am a 71-year-old wheelchair user with a multiple of needs due to having (had) a heart attack and a stroke. The support I received with these maladies, I have to say, was top drawer.
                            <br>
                            On the whole my time spent here has been both challenging and satisfactory. Equally the time and effort the staff put in, on a daily basis, is both rewarding and commending.
                            <br>
                            I would recommend others to apply for residence here believing that Tayview is by far, having experienced all of the other supported accommodations in Perth, one of a kind."
